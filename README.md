# high-low App

##Purpose
This is a front-end app that allows a user to enter a numeric range.
Once the range is determined the app generates a random integer. The user 
proceeds to guess what the random integer is. Once the correct number is guessed
a success message is displayed with the number of guesses tried, not including 
duplicate guesses or guesses that were not positive integers. The app distinguishes
if a range has been set before guessing. User must enter a positive int or the prompt
will continue to prompt. The app will round decimal inputs to the nearest whole number.
Appropriate messages are displayed depending on user input.
